# Tech Connect Documentation

## Overview

Tech Connect is a web-based application that facilitates connecting people who teach technical topics with people who need to learn these resources. The platform allows users to sign up as either teachers or learners, specify their technology interests and availability, and get matched based on common availability and technology choices.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, sign in, and profile management
- **Role-Based System**: Users can register as either teachers or learners
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their personal information and upload profile photos
- **Technology Selection**: Users can select technologies they want to teach or learn
- **Availability Scheduling**: Users can set their weekly availability for sessions
- **Matching Algorithm**: Learners can find teachers based on technology and availability
- **Connection Management**: Users can manage connection requests and accepted connections
- **Notification System**: Users receive notifications for connection requests, acceptances, and messages
- **Messaging Interface**: Connected users can communicate through a built-in messaging system
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: D1 Database (SQLite-compatible)
- **Authentication**: Custom authentication system with session management
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers compatible

- **users**: Stores user information including role (teacher/learner)
- **technologies**: List of available technologies
- **user_technologies**: Junction table linking users to technologies
- **user_availability**: Stores user availability schedules
- **connections**: Records connections between teachers and learners
- **messages**: Stores messages between connected users
- **notifications**: Stores notifications for users

## User Flows

### Teacher Flow

1. Register as a teacher
2. Complete profile with personal information and photo
3. Select technologies to teach and set proficiency levels
4. Set availability for teaching sessions
5. Receive connection requests from learners
6. Accept or reject connection requests
7. Message with connected learners

### Learner Flow

1. Register as a learner
2. Complete profile with personal information and photo
3. Select technologies to learn
4. Set availability for learning sessions
5. Find teachers manually or use the matching algorithm
6. Send connection requests to teachers
7. Message with connected teachers

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

Follow the installation steps above to run the application locally.

### Production Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed on Cloudflare Workers:

1. Configure your Cloudflare account and create a D1 database
2. Update the `wrangler.toml` file with your database details
3. Deploy using Wrangler:
   ```
   wrangler deploy
   ```

Alternatively, the application can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js applications.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure your database migrations have been applied correctly
- **Authentication Problems**: Clear browser cookies and try logging in again
- **Missing Profile Information**: Ensure all required profile fields are completed
- **Matching Algorithm Not Working**: Verify that both teachers and learners have set their availability and selected technologies
