# Joel Greenblatt's "You Can Be a Stock Market Genius" - Key Principles

## 1. Special Situations Investing

### Spin-offs
- Companies that are spun off from parent companies often outperform the market
- Institutional investors often sell spin-off shares without analyzing their value
- Insiders often have incentives aligned with spin-off success
- Look for insider ownership and purchasing in the spin-off

### Mergers and Acquisitions
- Look for merger securities that are overlooked by the market
- Analyze merger arbitrage opportunities
- Focus on the risk/reward ratio of merger situations

### Restructurings
- Companies emerging from bankruptcy can present good investment opportunities
- Look for companies with strong assets but temporary financial difficulties
- Management changes during restructuring can lead to improved performance

### Risk Arbitrage
- Analyze announced deals for potential profit opportunities
- Calculate downside risk if deal falls through vs. upside potential if completed

## 2. Value Metrics

### Return on Capital (ROC)
- Measures how efficiently a company uses its capital
- Formula: EBIT / (Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets)
- Higher ROC indicates better company performance and management

### Earnings Yield
- Measures how inexpensive a company is relative to its earnings
- Formula: EBIT / Enterprise Value
- Higher earnings yield indicates potentially undervalued company

## 3. Magic Formula Investing

### Core Principles
- Combines quality (high ROC) with value (high earnings yield)
- Ranks companies based on these two metrics
- Invests in top-ranked companies systematically

### Implementation
- Screen for companies above a certain market cap
- Exclude financial and utility companies
- Rank companies by ROC and earnings yield
- Invest in top-ranked companies
- Hold for one year, then rebalance

## 4. General Investment Principles

### Concentrated Portfolio
- Focus on best ideas rather than broad diversification
- 5-8 well-researched positions can provide adequate diversification

### Catalyst Identification
- Look for events that will unlock value (spin-offs, asset sales, etc.)
- Catalysts reduce the time required for market to recognize value

### Margin of Safety
- Buy at a significant discount to intrinsic value
- Provides protection against analytical errors or unforeseen events

### Contrarian Thinking
- Look where others aren't looking
- Institutional constraints create opportunities for individual investors
- Areas of market neglect often contain the best opportunities
